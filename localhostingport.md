Your Local IPv4 Address:
nginx
Copy
Edit
IPv4 Address: 192.168.29.89
This is your local/private IP address on the LAN (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). Devices on the same Wi-Fi/network can access this IP directly.

üåê To Make It Accessible from Other Devices:
‚úÖ 1. Devices on the Same Wi-Fi (LAN)
Use this in browser or API call from other devices:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://192.168.29.89:8080
Make sure:

Your Docker app is running and listening on port 8080.

Windows firewall allows incoming connections on port 8080.

üåé 2. Devices on Other Networks (Outside LAN)
To access from outside (like mobile data, another Wi-Fi, etc.), follow these steps:

üîß Step-by-Step for Global Access
‚úÖ Step 1: Check Public IP
Go to https://whatismyipaddress.com
Example: 49.43.1.9 (as you mentioned earlier)

This is your public IP assigned by ISP.

‚úÖ Step 2: Set Up Port Forwarding in Router
Open browser ‚Üí go to: http://192.168.29.1 (your default gateway)

Log in to your router admin panel

Go to Port Forwarding / Virtual Server / NAT section

Add a rule:

Field	Value
External Port	8080
Internal IP	192.168.29.89
Internal Port	8080
Protocol	TCP

Save & Restart the router (if required)

‚úÖ Step 3: Allow Windows Firewall Port
Run this in CMD as admin:

bash
Copy
Edit
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 8080" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8080
‚úÖ Step 4: Test Global Access
Try from another device or network:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://49.43.1.9:8080
Replace with your real public IP (can change on reboot unless you have static IP)

üîí TIP: Use Ngrok for Safer, Easier Sharing
If you don‚Äôt want to mess with routers, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g ngrok
ngrok http 8080
This will give you a URL like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://abcdef.ngrok.io
That you can share globally instantly.

Would you like help setting up Ngrok or your router's port forwarding page? I can guide you with screenshots if you tell me your router brand (e.g., TP-Link, D-Link, JioFiber, Airtel).
